# **Lab 02: Configure security and compliance for teams and content**

## **Lab Scenario**

In the labs of this course, you will assume the role of the System Administrator for Contoso Ltd. Your organization is planning to deploy Microsoft Teams. Before starting the deployment, IT department is gathering business requirements about Teams governance as well as data security and compliance, including how the data shared in Teams be regulated according to the organization’s compliance requirements. After you complete the planning process, you will configure Microsoft 365 Groups governance, protect Teams from threats, and configure Teams to meet your organization compliance requirements.

## **Objectives**

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

- Activate, create and assign sensitivity labels

- Configure expiration policies

- Restrict creation of new teams to members of a security group

- Create naming policies

- Reset all Azure AD settings to defaults

- Activating Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive and Teams

- Create, configure and test retention policies

- Create and test a DLP policy to protect GDPR content

## **Lab Setup**

- **Estimated Time:** 90 minutes.

## **Instructions**



### **Exercise 1: Implement governance and lifecycle management for Microsoft Teams**

Your organization has started the planning process for Microsoft 365 services adoption. You are assigned as a Teams admin role to plan Teams governance. Since Teams relies on Microsoft 365 groups, you need to plan governance procedures for Microsoft 365 groups, including creating, configuring and assigning sensitivity labels, creating Microsoft 365 groups expiration policies, configuring Microsoft 365 Group creation policy permissions, configuring and test Microsoft 365 Groups naming policies.


```
Note : 
Please note that odl_userXXXXX@<YourTenant>.onmicrosoft.com is your administrator user and you should use odl_userXXXXX@<YourTenant>.onmicrosoft.com in place of MOD Administrator (admin@<YourTenant>.onmicrosoft.com) throughout this lab
``` 

#### Assign Teams Admin Roles to users

In this task, you will use the default global admin to login to the Microsoft 365 admin center and assign several teams admin roles to different users. This task is crucial for the following tasks and exercises because you will perform most of the tasks in context of Joni Sherman’s account.

1. Sign in to the **Microsoft 365 admin center** ([**https://admin.microsoft.com**](https://admin.microsoft.com/)) using **MOD Administrator** (admin@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com).

2. Assign the role of the **Teams Administrator** to **Joni Sherman**.

3. Assign the role of the **Teams communication support engineer** to **Allan Deyoung**.

4. Leave the client open at the **Microsoft 365 admin center**.

You have now successfully assigned the Teams admin role to Joni Sherman and the Teams communications support engineer to Allan Deyoung. Proceed to the next task.


### Create groups and teams

In this exercise, you will create some resources required in later tasks. These include creating a Microsoft 365 Group from the Microsoft 365 admin center and creating a team in the Desktop client and then the web client.

#### Create a Microsoft 365 Group

In real world scenarios, the Microsoft 365 Groups would already exist and your task as Teams Administrator would only be to enable their Teams functionality, but for this lab you need to create them manually.

You will create the new Microsoft 365 Group named "IT-Department" and then add the pilot members serving as a basis for your future teams and licensing.

1. Sign in to the **Microsoft 365 admin center** ([**https://admin.microsoft.com**](https://admin.microsoft.com/)) as **Joni Sherman** (JoniS@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com).

2. Create and configure a new Microsoft 365 group with the following settings:

	- Name: **IT-Department**

	- Description: **All staff of the IT-Department**

	- Owners: **Joni Sherman**

	- Group email address: **IT-Department**@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com

	- Privacy: **Private – Only members can see group content**

	- Create a team for this group: **Clear the checkbox**

	- Members: **Alex Wilber, Allan Deyoung, Lynne Robbins** and **Megan Bowen**

3. Close the **Microsoft 365 admin center**.

The new Microsoft 365 Group with the name "IT-Department" was successfully created. Close the browser window and continue to the next task.

#### Create a new team by using the desktop client

To test the self-service capabilities of Teams, in this task, Megan Bowen will sign in to the Teams Desktop client, create a new team with the name "Teams Rollout" and add all members participating in the Teams evaluation project.

1. Connect to the **Client 2 VM** with the credentials that have been provided to you.

2. Connect to a client and sign in to the Teams Desktop client using **Megan Bowen** (MeganB@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com).

3. Create a new team with the following settings:

	- Type: **Build a team from scratch**

	- Privacy: **Public**

	- Name: **Teams Rollout**

	- Owners: **Joni Sherman** and **Megan Bowen**

	- Members: **Alex Wilber**, **Allan Deyoung** and **Lynne Robbins**

4. Close the Teams Desktop client.

You have successfully created a new team with the Teams Desktop client, added the project team members and you have made Joni Sherman a second owner of the team. Close the Teams client and continue with the next task.

#### Create a new team by using the web client

In this task, Lynne Robbins will continue testing the self-service capabilities of Teams by using the Teams web client to create another team with the name "Sales". She will also add Megan Bowen as a member.

1. Sign in to the Teams web client ([**https://teams.microsoft.com**](https://teams.microsoft.com/)) using **Lynne Robbins** (LynneR@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com).

2. Create a new team with the following settings:

	- Type: **Build a team from scratch**

	- Privacy: **Private**

	- Name: **Sales**

	- Owners: **Lynne Robbins**

	- Members: **Megan Bowen**

3. Close the Teams web client.

You have successfully created a new team with the Teams web client. This is the end of lab 1. .
#### Task 1 – Activate sensitivity labels for Teams 

You need to evaluate governance for Microsoft 365 Groups before deploying them in your organizations. In this task, you will activate the sensitivity labels for Teams in Azure AD, for being able to assign labels in a following task.

1. Connect to the **Client 1 VM** with the credentials that have been provided to you.

2. On the taskbar at the bottom of the page, right select the **Start** button and then select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.

3. Confirm the User Account Control window with **Yes**.

4. Maximize the PowerShell window and enter the following cmdlet to install the **Azure AD Preview** module:
  
   ```powershell
   Install-Module AzureADPreview
   ```
5. When you are prompted to install from the untrusted repository, confirm by entering **Y** and pressing Enter.

6. Type in the following cmdlet to connect to Azure AD in your tenant:

   ```powershell
   Connect-AzureAD
   ```
7. A **Sign in** dialog box will open. Sign in as admin@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com using the credentials provided to you.

8. To enable Microsoft 365 Groups and Teams for Sensitivity labels, you first need to load the Azure AD unified group template, by using the following cmdlet:

   ```powershell
   $Template = Get-AzureADDirectorySettingTemplate | Where {$_.DisplayName -eq "Group.Unified"}
   ```
9. Check if an Azure AD setting is already existing and load it, if yes. If not, create a blank Azure AD setting object. Run the following cmdlet to populate the "$Setting" variable:

   ```powershell
   if(!($Setting = Get-AzureADDirectorySetting | Where {$_.TemplateId -eq $Template.Id})) {$Setting = $Template.CreateDirectorySetting()}
   ```
10. Enable the Microsoft Identity Protection (MIP) support in your configuration:
    ```powershell
    $Setting["EnableMIPLabels"] = "True"
    ```
11. To verify the new configuration, run the following cmdlet:
    ```powershell
    $Setting.Values
    ```
12. Save the changes and apply the setting:

    ```powershell
    New-AzureADDirectorySetting -DirectorySetting $Setting
    ```
	**Note:** Since this is a new tenant, there’s no directory settings object in the tenant yet. You need to use ```New-AzureADDirectorySetting``` to create a directory settings object at the first time.

	If there’s an existing directory settings object, you will need to run the following cmdlet to update the directory setting in Azure Active Directory:

	```powershell
	Set-AzureADDirectorySetting -Id $Setting.Id -DirectorySetting $Setting
	```
13. Close the PowerShell window.

You have successfully changed your tenants Azure AD settings and activated sensitivity labels for Microsoft 365 Groups and Microsoft Teams.
